    Fields must NOT be accessible from outside the class.  
- Add two constructors to the `Employee` class:
    - The first constructor without parameters;
    - The second constructor should accept two arguments in order to initialize a new `Employee` entirely.  
- Add three methods to the `Employee` class:
    - The first method should NOT be accessible from outside the class. It should return the age value in the string format;
    - The second method should change employee's surname with a new value, which must be passed to the method;
